# novelweb

HTML finished at commit #2b4a81f.
-
For the second part of the project, I worked on a pop-up nav bar that will show up if you hover over the nav-bar icon at the top of the page. An item on the nav bar will change to a darker blue (the text will become white) if hovered over; when clicked, it will smoothy scroll the user down to the section that they wish to visit.

CSS finished at commit #9e1bee1.
-

Bootstrap I finished at commit #a98dd87.
-
The five special features I did were the alert (on both novelweb_home and novelweb_derp), modified Bootstrap table, spinner, form (on novelweb_derp, but it doesn't work), and input (on novelweb_home, and it also doesn't work).

-
Update: merged with other HTML project. Original scripts are novelweb_home.html and novelweb_derp.html.
