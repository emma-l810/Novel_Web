HTML finished at commit #2b4a81f.

For the second part of the project, I worked on a pop-up nav bar that will show up if you hover over the nav-bar icon at the top of the page. An item on the nav bar will change to a darker blue (the text will become white) if hovered over; when clicked, it will smoothy scroll the user down to the section that they wish to visit.

CSS finished at commit #9e1bee1.
