        <p>Top 3 Things People Are Afraid Of According to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us
          /blog/fixing-families/201908/what-are-you-most-afraid">Psychology Today</a>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Abandonment</li>
          <li>Rejection</li>
          <li>Failure</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you really think about it, abandonment, rejection, and failure can all be tied
        to death in some way or the other--all fears can be.</p>

        <p>
          Death, hands down, is the scariest thing ever, and is singehandedly the
          easiest way to erase a person's existence from history. However, with the internet,
          it's easy to leave something behind; it might never be recognized or noticed,
          but most people don't have any room to complain (except me and Elon Musk, probably).
          This is going to be the first of hopefully many things I leave behind--a sort of
          personal conquest, if you will, of my own fears to future readers that will transcend
          time and centennial differences. I expect future internet archeologists to be amazed.

        </div>

        <p>
          It is scientifically proven that immortality is as mythological as the Philosopher's
          Stone (and that alchemy is not actually a science). Don't believe me? Check the link:
          <i>
            <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/science-technology/immortality-is-mathematically
          -impossible-new-research-finds-58983"> it's hard-core science.</a>
          </i>
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-m-12 col-lg-6 col-xl-4"><center>
            <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block img-thumbnail" src="https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0a88da520b21397dbfa8da8914753e3c"

          <div class="col-m-12 col-lg-6 col-xl-4">
            <p>
              There are organizations who claim they will make immortality a reality, but
              it's not going to be in this body, nor will that life be as organic and new because
              it is our body that deteriorates, and it is a dead body that makes a dead person. Instead,
              we'll probably all become datachips stored in a hunk of metal parts. Which, granted,
              is better than nothing, but seriously, does that guy look even remotely human to you?
            </p>

            <p>
              No offense, but I would not want to be him. Or her, for that matter. The purpose
              of immortality is to stay alive (and preferably young) forever in the body that you
              have. Storing yourself in a computer or robot isn't that. And though some people may
              argue that we can probably design the features of a robot to very closely match your own,
              it's probably not going to look the same--or downright creepy due to the Uncanny Valley effect.
            </p>

          <div class="col-lg-12 col-xl-4">
            <p>
              Because we are humans and like to think of ourselves as having some divine purpose above
              simple reproduction like all other lifeforms, it's difficult to wrap our heads around
              the fact that, maybe, we're just like everything else that lives: we are life, but
              we are not eternal, and perhaps life--consciousness, to be more exact--is an illusion
              we paint for ourselves on an old canvas in danger of crumbling.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am definitely not an exception; I'm making this webpage, after all. I'm not incredibly
              optimistic though. I think that it is more than likely that our (G-g)ods, heavens, and
              afterlives (or rebirth if you're into that sort of thing) are figments of our warped reality,
              a manefestation of our yearning hope that we are not disposible or easily forgettable.
              That's why I'm making this webpage.

          I once chatted with a friend over what it would be like to take over the world, and this
          is a quote I directly copied from the text. <a href="novelweb_derp.html" target="_blank">(If you want
          to learn more about your future emperor, click here.)</a> I'm not really ambitious in that way (I'd
          rather explore space. If I got to Mars first, can you image all the press coverage I'd get? Neil
          Armstrong wouldn't be able to <i>touch</i> me.), but he's got the dream. It's certainly one way

          <span><strong>Legacy.</strong></span> It transcends stardom in every way because it extends to the future.
          Who in the world will remember Taylor Swift a hundred years from now? Maybe they'll remember some
          blond chick who made music (or movies, who knows), but really. With all her successes today,
          you'd expect better. But Leonardo da Vinci? The guy died in 1519 and still, his name is
          praised today. Scientist, artist, architect, engineer, the works. <em>That's</em> a legacy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Legacy is the alternative, the other way to preserve a part of ourselves onto this plane (whatever
          it may be, I'm not philsophical enough to guess). It's something that we leave behind. Legacy is
          not immortality--we've established that that's not quite realistic--but it's something.

              The reason these four things have been placed here, specifically, is not just because

              through these "milestones" that I have adopted such an investment in "being remembered". No in-depth

            <p>
              I have included MIT's curriculum guide. This thing links to the five departments, which link
              to more stuff. It is a representation of choice: the act of selecting or making a decision when faced with
              two or more possibilities (Google).
            </p>

            <p>
              I don't know whether choices can define who we are (as half the time they're made with one eye
              closed), but I can confirm how important it is to make them because inevitably, it is our choices
              that will be remembered, much more than our personalities or who we were as people. Actions speak
              louder than words and character, I suppose.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-12 col-xl-4">
            <p>
              So how can we make good decisions, because that is the ultimate question, isn't it? You'd expect this
              entire ramble to end in a glorious fireshower of wisdom, or the secret--genie's lamp, if you will--to
              finally be presented to you. But that's not the point at all. The truth is, this entire rambling <i>does</i>
              lead up to this point, but not to form any conclusions since I don't have any. Again, I'll remind you the
              purpose is to preserve my legacy, not to educate you since I doubt I could--things have probably changed
              a hundred years in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, it would probably be good to try anyway, to leave some sort of impression on you because that's
              what writers do. I can't just be remembered for being me, can I? <em>Actions speak louder than words and
              character.</em>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          The first thing to understand about choice is that <strong>there are varying levels of importance</strong>.
          Meaning, some decisions are more important than others. You'd be surprised how many people don't know this.
          Here is where I tell you to choose your priorities: a very important choice that will define all
          that you do for much of your life (undoubtably one of the more high-stakes choices). The rest of your
          important choices will depend on this. What do you like? What do you want? Such generic questions will help
          you get to the specifics.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next, <strong>you must be willing to make mistakes</strong>. You <em>will mess up.</em> That is a fact that will
          never change. What's important is that you:

          <ol>
            <li>Learn</li>
            <li>Never do it again</li>
          </ol>

        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps what deserves most emphasis, however, is <strong>taking risks</strong>. The beauty of choice is
          that there <em>is no "right"</em>--you can never make a wrong choice. Your decisions can certainly lead to
          negative consequences, but they're not necessarily wrong (because the other paths could be just as bad, though
          we will never know). Life is a risk, as you probably have heard. The safest option is, inevitably, death,
          because it is the only certainty that will yield the same results every time. Everything uncertain is a
          risk, but it's the only way to move forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your success lies in the success of your choices. Your legacy depends on how much of an impact your
          choices make. This, invariably, is the secret, I believe. I could be wrong, but this is my take. (Frankly,
          I don't think I'm wrong. It's not that complicated, just hard to accomplish.)

          Whatever happens to this page I won't know, but I do hope you'll remember something. In doing so, my legacy is
