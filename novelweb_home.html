    </div>

    <p>First, salutations and greetings to you. Welcome to the page. Please, read on.</p>

    <p>Top 3 Things People Are Afraid Of According to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us
      /blog/fixing-families/201908/what-are-you-most-afraid">Psychology Today</a>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Abandonment</li>
      <li>Rejection</li>
      <li>Failure</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you really think about it, abandonment, rejection, and failure can all be tied
    to death in some way or the other--all fears can be.</p>

    <p>
      Death, hands down, is the scariest thing ever, and is singehandedly the
      easiest way to erase a person's existence from history. However, with the internet,
      it's easy to leave something behind; it might never be recognized or noticed,
      but most people don't have any room to complain (except me and Elon Musk, probably).
      This is going to be the first of hopefully many things I leave behind--a sort of
      personal conquest, if you will, of my own fears to future readers that will transcend
      time and centennial differences. I expect future internet archeologists to be amazed.
    </p>

    <div class="headings">
      <a id="on_the_subject_of_immortality"><h3>On the Subject of Immortality</h3></a>
    </div>

    <p>
      It is scientifically proven that immortality is as mythological as the Philosopher's
      Stone (and that alchemy is not actually a science). Don't believe me? Check the link:
      <i>
        <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/science-technology/immortality-is-mathematically
      -impossible-new-research-finds-58983"> it's hard-core science.</a>
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      There are organizations who claim they will make immortality a reality, but
      it's not going to be in this body, nor will that life be as organic and new because
      it is our body that deteriorates, and it is a dead body that makes a dead person. Instead,
      we'll probably all become datachips stored in a hunk of metal parts. Which, granted,
      is better than nothing, but seriously, does that guy look even remotely human to you?
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0a88da520b21397dbfa8da8914753e3c" alt="Girl
      meets metal robot boyfriend" style="width:400px;height:200px" />
    </center>

    <p>
      No offense, but I would not want to be him. Or her, for that matter. The purpose
      of immortality is to stay alive (and preferably young) forever in the body that you
      have. Storing yourself in a computer or robot isn't that. And though some people may
      argue that we can probably design the features of a robot to very closely match your own,
      it's probably not going to look the same--or downright creepy due to the Uncanny Valley effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because we are humans and like to think of ourselves as having some divine purpose above
      simple reproduction like all other lifeforms, it's difficult to wrap our heads around
      the fact that, maybe, we're just like everything else that lives: we are life, but
      we are not eternal, and perhaps life--consciousness, to be more exact--is an illusion
      we paint for ourselves on an old canvas in danger of crumbling. I am definitely not
      an exception; I'm making this webpage, after all. I'm not incredibly optimistic though.
      I think that it is more than likely that our (G-g)ods, heavens, and afterlives (or
      rebirth if you're into that sort of thing) are figments of our warped reality, a
      manefestation of our yearning hope that we are not disposible or easily forgettable.
      That's why I'm making this webpage.

    <blockquote style="text-align:center" cite="http://nowherefromnowhere.com">
      <em>"Countries are mere vessels of granfaloonism. Petty little threads that meaninglessly
      pretend to tie humans together when in fact they drive humans further apart. A single
      world must be created under my rule where all are truly equal: an empire of infinite
      wealth and power. That is the way."</em> - Aaron C.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      I once chatted with a friend over what it would be like to take over the world, and this
      is a quote I directly copied from the text. <a href="novelweb_derp.html" target="_blank">(If you want
      to learn more about your future emperor, click here.)</a> I'm not really ambitious in that way (I'd
      rather explore space. If I got to Mars first, can you image all the press coverage I'd get? Neil
      Armstrong wouldn't be able to <i>touch</i> me.), but he's got the dream. It's certainly one way
      to leave your mark on the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span><strong>Legacy.</strong></span> It transcends stardom in every way because it extends to the future.
      Who in the world will remember Taylor Swift a hundred years from now? Maybe they'll remember some
      blond chick who made music (or movies, who knows), but really. With all her successes today,
      you'd expect better. But Leonardo da Vinci? The guy died in 1519 and still, his name is
      praised today. Scientist, artist, architect, engineer, the works. <em>That's</em> a legacy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Legacy is the alternative, the other way to preserve a part of ourselves onto this plane (whatever
      it may be, I'm not philsophical enough to guess). It's something that we we leave behind. Legacy is
      not immortality--we've established that that's not quite realistic--but it's something.

      <a id="my_backstory"><h3>The Backstory Story</h3></a>
    </div>

    <p>
      Many famous writers say that to understand--and more importantly, <i>trust</i>--someone, you
      first have to be given context: a backstory, if you will. So here is my summary of the important bits.
      It doesn't look impressive, but I'll explain why I included it soon enough.
    </p>

    <table class="center">
      <caption>Truly Extraordinary Resume</caption>
      <tr>
        <th>Accomplishments</th>
        <th>Dates of Each Thing</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Was accepted into the Bishop's school</td>
        <td>2018</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Survived freshmen year</td>
        <td>2018-2019</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Learned "Payphone" on the piano at IUPA</td>
        <td>2019</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Didn't take AP Euro (self-explanatory)</td>
        <td>2019-2020</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The reason these four things have been placed here, specifically, is not just because
      it's chronological, but also because they each represent a milestone in my character development.
      Remember, I did say this was as much a personal conquest as it is an existential one. It is really
      through these "milestones" that I have adopted such an investment in "being remembered".
    </p>

    <p>
      When I was accepted into Bishop's as a freshmen, it was the start of high school, but also
      an introduction to a whole new way of thinking (and hypocrasy in the sense that despite being an
      elite private school, there was still bird poop everywhere). It was here that I really began to
      realize just how many "extraordinary"--at least by my definition--people there were, and it was
      disheartening to think just how few of them (me included) would make much of an impact. But this
      really came after freshmen year: sophomore year was the year of realizations and mindblowing
      discoveries. Freshmen year I focused on making friends and passing math without breaking down at
      the thought of a test.
    </p>

    <p>
      At IUPA, a piano summer camp I did over the summer of 2019, I got to meet a lot of talented
      pianists who I realized were kids just like me; I wasn't the best there, but I certainly wasn't the
      worst either. And we were all immature enough to hang out in the practice rooms playing pop covers when
      we should have been practicing Vine sonatas. I realized here that some people were satisfied with
      merely finding happiness in life: an admirable goal, certainly, but not one I could ever find myself
      satisfied with.
    </p>

    <p>
      The final one, the AP Euro decision, was probably the biggest decision I ever made. Not even
      kidding, I was plagued with indecision and doubt months after the decision had been made. Surprisingly,
      it's not as significant to the story as it looks; I learned that I didn't have to take Euro if I didn't
      want to, but that's honestly no big deal.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, you know me. Briefly, not enough to even be acquaintances, but that's not the point. I am a
      voice from the past speaking to you; now that you know me, you may be more likely to listen. And then,
      remember.

      <a id="importance_of_choice"><h3>The Importance of Choice and Decisions</h3></a>
    </div>

    <p>
      Below I have included the Bishop's curriculum guide. This thing is 112 pages; over 3/4 of it is
      classes. It is a representation of choice: the act of selecting or making a decision when faced with
      two or more possibilities (Google).
    </p>

    <center>
      <iframe src="https://bishops.myschoolapp.com/ftpimages/613/download/download_3960751.pdf" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
      Bishop's Curriculum Guide</iframe>
    </center>

    <p>
      I don't know whether choices can define who we are (as half the time they're made with one eye
      closed), but I can confirm how important it is to make them because inevitably, it is our choices
      that will be remembered, much more than our personalities or who we were as people. Actions speak
      louder than words and character, I suppose.
    </p>

    <p>
      So how can we make good decisions, because that is the ultimate question, isn't it? You'd expect this
      entire ramble to end in a glorious fireshower of wisdom, or the secret--genie's lamp, if you will--to
      finally be presented to you. But that's not the point at all. The truth is, this entire rambling <i>does</i>
      lead up to this point, but not to form any conclusions since I don't have any. Again, I'll remind you the
      purpose is to preserve my legacy, not to educate you since I doubt I could--things have probably changed
      a hundred years in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, it would probably be good to try anyway, to leave some sort of impression on you because that's
      what writers do. I can't just be remembered for being me, can I? <em>Actions speak louder than words and
      character.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first thing to understand about choice is that <strong>there are varying levels of importance</strong>.
      Meaning, some decisions are more important than others. You'd be surprised how many people don't know this.
      Here is where I tell you to choose your priorities: a very important choice that will define all
      that you do for much of your life (undoubtably one of the more high-stakes choices). The rest of your
      important choices will depend on this. What do you like? What do you want? Such generic questions will help
      you get to the specifics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, <strong>you must be willing to make mistakes</strong>. You <em>will mess up.</em> That is a fact that will
      never change. What's important is that you:

      <ol>
        <li>Learn</li>
        <li>Never do it again</li>
      </ol>

    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps what deserves most emphasis, however, is <strong>taking risks</strong>. The beauty of choice is
      that there <em>is no "right"</em>--you can never make a wrong choice. Your decisions can certainly lead to
      negative consequences, but they're not necessarily wrong (because the other paths could be just as bad, though
      we will never know). Life is a risk, as you probably have heard. The safest option is, inevitably, death,
      because it is the only certainty that will yield the same results every time. Everything uncertain is a
      risk, but it's the only way to move forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your success lies in the success of your choices. Your legacy depends on how much of an impact your
      choices make. This, invariably, is the secret, I believe. I could be wrong, but this is my take. (Frankly,
      I don't think I'm wrong. It's not that complicated, just hard to accomplish.)

      Every great essay needs one of these, and this isn't even an essay. It's neither grand nor much of anything.
      I'm tired; this was hard to write, and it was only supposed to be an assignment? Instead, I have poured out
      much of my musings from the last few months onto this webpage.
      Whatever happens to this page I won't know, but I do hope you'll remember something. In doing so, my legacy is
      carried forward through you. Even if you don't share, I won't disappear. So thank you and farewell.
